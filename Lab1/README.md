In this lab, we delve into the FPGA High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow.

Our objective is to design a multiplier with `2 inputs` and `1 output`, subsequently exporting it to RTL IP. This will then be deployed on the PYNQ-Z2 MPSoC PL side. The PYNQ Arm core will run a Python program that invokes the multiplier IP to compute the result.

We will then assess both its performance and utilization.
